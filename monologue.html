    <h3 style="font-size:30px;">Should I Get Therapy? By Archie Andrews</h3> <br>
	
So, let me say a little bit about what’s been going on in my life. Hmm, where do I begin? It started back when Jason Blossom died and my friends and I, who had just started high school, had to figure out who killed him. Ah, freshman year. Ronnie had just moved to town… I was doing great in football… OH Jason Blossom’s death! Yeah, turns out it was his dad, who then killed himself. Heh… and I thought it was all over, but then my dad gets shot by some psycho in a ski mask. He’s fine now though…yeah that whole situation wasn’t great. I mayyyy have developed a bit of a superhero complex because of it. I started a vigilante group called the red circle, with the whole high school football team, shirtless, naturally. I needed to take some power back from this guy. I mean, what was I supposed to do? Leave it to the police, or… adults? Ugh. They don’t know anything. Obviously, I, a 15 year old boy who was in emotional turmoil, had the best judgment in the situation. Some things that cheer me up though… hmm… Oh! I do have my music. I started playing guitar and singing a couple years ago when I was having an affair with my hot 35 year old music teacher, Ms Grundy.  I also spend at least 12 hours everyday at the gym, working out, with my shirt off, because that’s normal. Don’t worry, that’s over now. Ronnie and I are together! We just said I love you to each other… yeah it’s going great. Well, mostly great. Her crazy crime mob boss father did throw me into juvie for a bit. I also kind of lost touch with my music. But let’s not even get into the underground fighting prison ring I was thrown into as an innocent 16 year old also in juvie. There wasn’t a lot of music making happening then. Anyway… Hiram Lodge. Gosh, I can’t believe I was thinking of working for Hiram Lodge. I realized that he was no good so I broke it off. Then, he got angry with me for threatening him and framed me and threw me in juvie so Veronica and I couldn’t be together anymore. Then he was hiring people to kill me in the underground fighting ring I mentioned earlier. Luckily, I broke out. Ronnie and I are great now. Though she was cheating on me with Reggie… It’s okay though. I don’t blame her for anything that happened, it’s not her fault that her dad is insane. Some of my other friends? Let’s see. Well, there is Betty. She’s my next door neighbor and my best friend. She’s always been there for me. Things have changed a bit since she started dating my best friend, Jughead and what happened a few years ago. Yeah, we found out that her dad was the Black Hood, a serial killer that was killing everyone in the town who had ever committed a sin, because that’s normal. He was also the psycho that shot my dad. Also that her half brother Chic wasn’t really her half brother and was also a serial killer and that she might have a gene called the “serial killer” gene- this was nothing compared to taking the SAT though. That test was insane. I think I’m dealing with things fine on my own though. Yeah…  I really don’t think I need therapy. Isn’t this stuff all normal teenagers go through?
